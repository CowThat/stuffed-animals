      &emsp;&emsp;I have an unhealthy obsesion with stuffed animals. Especially Squishmallows. When I see their stupid faces, it makes me smile so much that I just feel compelled to buy them and squish them. I literally can not stop myself – it's a bit of a problem. Whenever I get a new stuffed animal or toy, I tend to give them a name and a backstory, but the problem is I have so many stuffed animals that I'm starting to forget them all. My memory's not the greatest, and as the collection grows, it gets harder and harder to keep track of it all. For a short time, I had forgotten the names of half of my stuffed animals, and I felt like such a bad stuffed animal dad.

      &emsp;&emsp;So, I'm making this website as a catalogue of all of them. In this, you can find information like their name, age, birthday, and stuff about their backstory. This will always be a work in progress, as I'm always thinking up new information about them at random.
